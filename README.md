## A Language Recognition and Interpretation Interface

The purpose of this project was to create a Node application that takes in user input and returns specific information using API calls.

The user can use one of 4 commands: "movie-this", "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", or "do-what-it-says".

### movie-this
This command allows the user to enter a name of a movie and the application will return basic movie info from the OMBD API, such as realease date, actors that star in the movie, plot, rating, etc...
